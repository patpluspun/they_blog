*How long are you going to sleep?*

His dry voice grated on my most pleasant dream, reminding me of the time.  I woke up,
peeling layers of slumber from my eyes with my knuckles.

"I didn't realize how late it was getting. Has my ticket finally come?"

His chuckle had this unearthly quality about it, like stone sliding over stone.

*Maybe it has, there's only one way to find out, you know.*

While the visits aren't unpleasant overall, the morbidity of the situation never
really wears off. Being awakened and interviewed by your own mortality is jarring.

At least at first. In time this somber chap had grown to be a great friend and confidant.
He has no agenda, no judgment of your character, no real personality to even speak of.
The only reason I call him a "he" is because of the suit he wears. Even his monotone,
humorless voice is somewhat androgynous, but it could be that same ethereal quality that
affects what counts for his laugh.

Our first meeting was a frightful one. Though he never said who he was, there is an aura
of unease that surrounds this entity, an unmistakable one. A slightly sharp smell of
some indeterminate origin. A face that never looks familiar no matter how often you see it.
A posture that looks utterly uncomfortable for any human being.

We've often discussed how romanticized the concept of death is. One time I tried to get
him to wear a robe and a skull mask like the grim reaper, and his silent disapproval was
all it took to bar that idea. He will very rarely answer questions with anything but a blank
stare, surely knowing that imparting knowledge to mere mortals is a rather fruitless 
activity.

"So what do you want to know today?".

I'm so used to this line of questioning.

*Tell me what you did yesterday.*

This is always what he wants. I can never tell if he truly doesn't know or if he's just
testing me on my honesty.

"I went to work, came home and cursed at the bumper to bumper traffic, then got some beer
and read news on the internet until dinner, ate, then watched a movie."

*What else?*

"I worked on some projects that are due soon, partook of some herbs, and then I masturbated
before bed"

*There's more.*

"I know, why do you always want me to talk about this?"

*You need to remind yourself.*

"Yes, she needed some help, I gave her money. Life isn't easy for everybody."

He smiled.

*Is that your justification? You aren't even convincing yourself.*

My jaw involuntarily dropped slightly at the nerve of this guy. Appearing in my bedroom every
day and demanding my time and information, and then daring to question my reasoning? I'm pretty 
sure I trembled in unenthusiastic rage for a brief moment.

*I think you're in denial of your problem.*

"Why is it automatically a problem?".  I'm not even sure if I thought about that response. In 
fact I feel certain his statement was constructed to create that response from me.

*Observe that I've been visiting every day for..  quite a while now.*

His voice was like a dagger tracing lines in my skin. This isn't the kind of stuff you want 
the reaper of the living saying to you.

*I can't take you until you're ready. You're almost there.*

"What do I need to do?" 

I can't believe I asked this question, but some morbid part of me just had to know the answer.

*This isn't a movie. I'm not Morgan Freeman. I am a custodian. My advice is rarely welcomed.*

I couldn't help but smile a bit at his joke. There's that hint of personality creeping out before
something totally soul shivering comes out of his mouth. It also sent me into a spiral of wondering
what the administration of the universe must be like if this guy is any example to go by.

"So, I'll spend today thinking about that, and try to have an answer for you tomorrow then?"

*The answer is for you, not me.*

And the next time I blinked, he was gone. I got up and took my morning constitutional and a glass
of grapefruit juice and a banana, just like any other day.
