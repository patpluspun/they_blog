Many a year has been spent obsessed

sailing aimlessly through unbroken mists

of wonder, discovery with no destination

paying no penitance to premeditation

allowing no quarter to anger and worry

my quarry a life lived in the utmost of hurry

the vessel's escutcheon had upon it's face emblazoned the screed

"The wind to our back is our penultimate creed"



Another wave and passing cloud turned

squall and horizon burned

every restless night another endless

dream has gone unyearned

Hopes dashed on stony shores

my vessel caught in a sudden storm

and then control is wrested violently

from my hold

from what I'm told



Awakening awashed on a familiar shoreline

my vessel a memory of driftwood and mooring line

Gathered my lumber, atoning for every uncrossed ocean

lashed to a frame erected to towering proportions

affixed to the apex I set a bright burning beacon

a balefire for the guidance of everyone who is seeking

a hearth for the weary who are in need of sleeping

a quay for itinerants in need of safekeeping



Fashioned a port from this rugged, ragged coal coast

a place to sit and drink and rest and exorcise old ghosts

the hauntings of the past are bared with every clink and toast

there I sit, and dutifully watch my post

standing tall and shining bright

this emblem of passing night

a monument to weathering the tribulations born with life

come and sit and be at home

have a drink, you're not alone

and know that destiny is not set in stone
