Will Will Wheaton eat one ton of wanton wheat wontons while wearing wheat thins within....

I'm blogging for the first time, pretty much ever.  It is a test of the Jekyll blog framework.


It is also a place I can convert all my ramblings into publicly available earworms, where you
are free to belittle me as you see fit.  Or say nice things, I won't promise everything I say
will be nice though.


We'll see!  It's super interesting building static sites and publishing up instead of dealing 
with live database edits and all that calamity.
