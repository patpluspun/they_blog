There are roughly 7.2 billion people on this planet, and we all have a relationship with every single one.

I tried to stretch this into every living organism, but it is really hard to calculate how much life there is.
There are billions of bacteria living in almost every complex organism, and many more just everywhere.  It is
incalculable to account for all that mess, so it is just us humans in this exploration.

We start life as a stranger to every single thing that we recognize, both human and inanimate. Many of us retain that relationship with 
the vast majority of humanity and things.

Within moments of being exposed to the cold air of the outside of our mother, many of us will be presented to the most important
person we will ever know. If we are lucky, we will get to meet possibly the second most important person.

We may have more people thrust upon us; brothers and sisters, cousins, family that you can never avoid. Then we have the people
we choose. Friends, lovers, maybe a spouse and children of your own. 

It would be interesting to know how many relationships the average human has throughout their life. Consider that every single person
we pass, even if we do not acknowledge them, now possesses a new relationship with you: the transition from unknown stranger to known stranger.
