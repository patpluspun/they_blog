Inviting innocence inward away 

Lips loiter lucidly languorously

O blessings of all blessingness blow betwixt thee

Veil of virtue so vexingly verdant   

Enraptured engorges egregiously

Pistil pokes pipelike precariously

Unwrapping unleashing unwaveringly urgent

Susceptible senses swell succulently 

Shuddering shivering shriekishly scream

Youthfully yawning Yggdrasil allayed
