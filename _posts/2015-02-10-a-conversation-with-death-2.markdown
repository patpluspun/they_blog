I was outside on the balcony, minding my own business.

Smoking a cigarette, just letting life roll over and the chaos defuse.

*What are you doing?*

I immediately gripped my head tightly.

And there he was, the wind not even whipping his loosely fitting suit.
He stood there on the corner like a gargoyle, overlooking so many people
unaware of this spector observing them. The sound of charcoal scraping 
in his joints as he shifted alerted me to his presence.

"I'm trying to relax, leave me alone."

I attempted to maintain more of a sense of annoyance than despair, and
I probably failed. Omniscient constructs of the cycle of life are hard
to fool.

*Is it helping?*

FUCKING CHRIST this dude knows how to get under my skin. Just stop asking
me things. Yet my silent plea will never help, even if it were heard.

"Of course it helps, the reason you hang around me so much is that you're
waiting for my time, right?"

He stepped closer, abrasively scraping every joint in his body as he did.

"Is this not something I should do?"

My desperation was showing, I could tell.

*You keep doing it, regardless.*

I sat and watched as he took two more steps closer, he was quickly hovering
directly over me, but I could sense no malice, and thus could feel no fear.

My thoughts spun as I tried to think of something to say. I'm used to puzzles,
but my brain was already muddled with what he was actually telling me. And
that's when I responded, probably with way more emotion than I should've.

"I must keep my friends close, right?"

I thought I was so clever. A wave of dissatisfaction swept me almost as soon
as I stopped thinking about what I said. I felt his icy cold sigh frost my
face, and the lack of breath in it almost made me choke.

*I'll just leave you with that, then.*

I stared into his featureless visage for a bit, and fought tears back. Thanks
for everything, yet again. Friend. I stared as long as I could, just to watch
him vanish, but as soon as I blinked his presence was gone. Again.

I smashed my cigarette out and went inside.
