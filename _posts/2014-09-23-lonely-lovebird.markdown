Scattered midst wintry howling wind; an echo in the night

A bittersweet chorus floats aloft; no music source in sight

Lingering faintly in one's ear, like church bells ring-a-ling

The saddest song that nature knows a lonely lovebird sings

****

Melody only somewhat there, a crass disjointed flow

Absent harmony only one other bird can know

Is it deaf to it's offkey tune, the silly broken thing?

A song that chills old winter's bones; the lonely lovebird sings

****

Where are the others of our ilk; the others of your kind?

They all flee more southerly yet you remain behind

Upon your branch you sing for all, your mate's eternal spring

A tune unfinished by itself a lonely lovebird sings

****

Winter's chill wraps you tightly, your voice is growing weak

Your song goes on despite the nearby freezing throes of sleep

A lovebird without partner, like a castle without king

And even to it's final note the lonely lovebird sings

****
