The cork pops, and rustic rapture consumes you. A hint of blueberry wafts as the sanguinous liquid splashes into the goblet.

**Drink deeply, love**, the dark, comforting voice beckons.

*I shouldn't*, she said.  *I have so many things to ponder..*

**But it will help your thoughts. It will ease your mind"

*I can have a sip, but no more.*, she said resolutely.
