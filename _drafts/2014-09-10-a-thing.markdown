A tangible insubstantialness, a dull echo ringing.

A boy in the shadows collapses while bringing.

A heavenly choir demoniacally singing.


Like a deafening darkness or dreaming of sleeping.

Allegiance to beings that wreak only weeping.

Lamenting the spirit that's so desperately keeping.


I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but it is a thing.
